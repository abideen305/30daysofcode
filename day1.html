<h1> APPRECIATION TO THE ONE I LOVE </h1>   
<img src="img/abideen.jpg" alt="my man" class="centre">
<h1> Abideen Muhammed </h1><hr>

<p> <center>  <b> The one I really love us is myself. I have gone through different hurdles in life, I have fought with many people, many injustices and many conspiracies. I have learnt to live independently. I have escaped many character-assasination authored by those who wished to bring me down. I was also once subject of discussion or to the extreme object of mockery to those nurture evils in their heart against a poor boy. Many have belittled and are still belittling what I can do because they never believed I will be there.</b> </center>  </p>
    <p>Luckily, I have also became source of strength to many, a political model and mentor and strength to those who wish to follow the same path. To those who always sit at the fence, the green snake, I have taught them lessons of their life. Such that many could not dare challenge me pyhsically. The worse they could do is going behind (following) backdoor to sit with their pay-masters to backbite and gossip about my life without a single clarification. <br> <br> Trust me, their mouth were left agape when they saw that I escaped their plot. The truth is, I also figured out the opportunists who really careless but just want to exploit you and dumb. I told myself, Abideen you must depart from them. Life goes beyond taking advantages of others. When they come to seek for help, they will humble themselves as if they love you but in the real sense hatred burns in their heart like flames. But then what was my offence? </p>
<p>The only thing I could remember was being a roadblock to thier ill political method and way of rulling. To their ancient styles of managing people and insincerity of intention which continues to divide brethren amidst themselves. <br> Isn't true that a house that is divided against itself can't stand alone let alone facing the enemies? Another sin i think I commited was helping people who are in need without mentioning thier names. They expect the glory but Allah willing, they are always met with one problem or the other. Those that stood apart only compromised the truth. But with Allah, I passed through all those struggles all alone. It made me.</p>
<p>I love myself because I did not let the past to hurt me or weigh me down. We moved on. We only put limit what we say to a stranger - those who only obtain from you without giving back. I really love myself and I will continue to love myself. I love Allah, my mum and the mother of my children, the one who knows herself...</p>
